      title: The Calling
      description: |-
        Begin your yatra from Rohanda village. Walk through cedar forests where
              every step feels like an initiation. This day is less about distance, more
              about leaving behind your everyday noise.
    - day: 2
      title: Into the Sacred Forests
      description: >-
        The climb becomes steeper. Silence deepens. You share simple meals with
        fellow yatris, and the mountains start whispering their ancient stories.
    - day: 3
      title: The Lake of Wishes
      description: >-
        Reach Kamrunag Lake — still, mystical, and vast like the sky itself. Here,
        people for centuries have offered wishes to the waters. Sit, reflect, and
        listen. The lake reflects not only the peaks, but your own heart.
    - day: 4
      title: Return as Someone Else
      description: >-
        The descent feels lighter, though the path is the same. What you carry is
        different now — clarity, strength, and a memory that will keep guiding you
        long after you leave.
