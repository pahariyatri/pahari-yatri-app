excerpt: >-
  On the ridge the day opens like a book of brightness, and each step is a
  note you didn’t know you could sing.

quote: The wind carries a tune from places we haven’t learned yet.

We begin where the slope loosens and the thyme puts a small green thought in the air. The pass lifts us into a clean grammar of light. I have walked this edge before, but not with this laughter, not with this ease. There is a rhythm that takes us in hand: the swaying grass, the carrying sky, the way the horizon arranges itself as if it knows we are coming.

When the ridge narrows, we meet a kindness in ourselves. The sun writes simple sentences on our faces, and we become readable to one another. Someone points to a far white line, the older season still lingering on a shadowed slope. We go on, speaking less, listening more. The mountain has its own song, a patient, generous tune. It is enough to be a small instrument.

By the cairn the wind gathers its choir and we stand slightly apart, hearing how a day can be held together by trust alone. In the valleys the rivers make their own liturgy, and we carry that soft ceremony in our breath as we return. The pass is behind us, but the song, somehow, continues.
