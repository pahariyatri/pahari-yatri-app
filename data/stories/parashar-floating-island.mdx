excerpt: >-
  A temple by water and an island that wandered slowly. We stood long enough to
  be revised by its calm.

quote: Reverence moves like the island—unhurried, precise.

The cedar path felt like a polite introduction to a place that deserved it. We spoke in low voices and let the hill do most of the talking. At the lake, the temple kept an old promise and the island kept moving, explanatory in its own way.

We watched it drift like a slow thought finding the right sentence. A priest told a story about patience and offerings, and for once the moral did not feel heavy. It felt accurate. Reverence is light enough to carry all day.

An elder asked if we wanted blessings for our journey. We did, and the words fell like warm rain. Nearby, a child laughed as the island slid past a reflection of clouds, turning them into travel companions.

When we left, we tried to keep our attention as well-tuned as the place we were leaving. The trail helped. The cedar hummed. And the valley sent us down like a letter written in a careful hand.
