There is a rhythm to the Rupin that a person can borrow for a while. We borrowed it and our shoulders lowered. The gullies asked for attention the way a careful book does—no scolding, only invitation. We moved as students happy to be corrected.

By the upper meadows, our conversation found the slower verbs. Someone told a story about a promise left behind in another season; the mountain respected it by being silent. When we crossed the snow, I felt something unlearned step aside and let something truer begin.

The pass did not announce itself. It arrived as if the day had matured. We stood a respectful minute and then went on, because that is a kind of respect too. Down in camp, the fire wrote its bright paragraph and we let the night read it back to us.
