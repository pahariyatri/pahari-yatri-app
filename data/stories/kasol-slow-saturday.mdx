We walked without trying to arrive. The market did its bright work and we let it, but our attention kept returning to the river. A child practiced throwing stones and the Parvati approved the curriculum.

At the bridge we paused the day and the day agreed. A slow chai stitched our conversation and no one hurried the seam. In the evening the lamps turned the path into a gentle constellation and we understood why the valley hosts so many soft beginnings.
