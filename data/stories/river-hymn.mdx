We matched the river’s cadence until our pockets held nothing but the sound it made. The bend asked us a kind question: will you read what I am saying? We did, haltingly, and the grammar of stones corrected us. You can move and still be held. You can rest and still be part of the sentence.

At the wide shingle, we learned to leave little and take less. The current braided light through the day, and our shadows kept a polite distance. Dragonflies turned the air into a precise calligraphy, and we forgot our names long enough to be present. That was the hymn: a brief forgetting that allows a deeper remembering.

When we left the water’s margin, the road spoke a different prose. We listened, but kept a river stanza in the mouth. Back at camp we built a bright paragraph of flame and let it punctuate the evening. It was enough to be near such fluent company.
