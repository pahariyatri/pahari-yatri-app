We began with the kind noise of leaves, a language I could speak without training. The trail climbed through Bhaba’s green rooms and our breathing found a respectful tempo. At a switchback someone pointed at a small shrine and we nodded as if it had greeted us first.

The pass itself felt like a hinge. On one side, pasture and rivers; on the other, an argument for silence written in stone and light. Spiti arrived the way a new chapter should—surprising, exact, inevitable.

Crossing into the desert, the horizon loosened its belt and we understood why people return to compare truths. The color palette had edited out our haste. By evening, we had better metaphors for friendship and effort, and that felt like a good day’s work.
