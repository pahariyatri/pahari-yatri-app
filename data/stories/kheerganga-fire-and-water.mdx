The forest lifted us in green paragraphs until the spring arrived, precise and kind. Steam braided the air and our shoulders considered a truce with the week. Someone said their thoughts had finally sat down. We believed them.

Later, the pass asked us for steady attention, not heroics. It was the right request. We placed our steps like punctuation and the ridge answered with completeness. A small flame of confidence stayed lit even in the wind.

On the return, we carried the valley’s grammar with us—rest beside effort, warmth beside height. By camp the fire revised us without argument, and the night agreed to keep our names safe.
