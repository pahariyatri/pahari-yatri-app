Winter had written its long sentence across the slopes and left a quiet period at the lake. We walked down the page until our boots reached the margin. The ice did not ask for proof. It asked for patience. We stood in a softness only cold can teach and felt our earlier words become modest.

Someone told the old story of gold dropped as an oath. I thought about brightness sinking until memory could hold it. In that thought the mountain made a small correction: what you keep is not what you hide, but what you are willing to honor when no one is looking.

We did not carve names on the snow. We did not shout. We offered a silence and received one back. It fit. On the return, fire stitched the evening with heat and we kept our promises the way one keeps a flame—by tending, by respect, by not asking it to become something else.
