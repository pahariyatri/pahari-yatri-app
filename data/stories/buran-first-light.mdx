We reached the snow bridge before the sun had finished its first sentence. The ice was a good editor—every footstep had to be definite and kind. Someone went quiet and we did not ask why. Courage is shy but generous when invited carefully.

Later, the route widened into a yellow grammar of grass and the group remembered how to laugh with breath instead of noise. We kept the mountain’s pacing, which is to say we stopped resisting time. A friend said they felt taller inside. I believed them.

At the pass the wind made a simple correction to our posture and we readjusted in gratitude. The horizon did a graceful thing and we did not miss it: it arrived and included us without ceremony. By camp, the sky had loosened our thoughts, and the pot of tea felt like a punctuation mark we had earned.
