excerpt: >-
  A lake tucked into hills drew us into its quiet circle. We walked slower and
  heard more than words.

We began late on purpose, so the day could be patient with us. The trail lifted in a friendly way, cedar offering shade and the occasional counsel: don’t rush; the lake prefers arrivals that remember how to be gentle.

When Jalori appeared, it didn’t insist. The water held a small round sentence and we understood what it meant without translation. Someone suggested we walk the edge in silence. We did, and the hush turned detailed—the colors of stones, the tone of wind, the soft congress of insects.

At a quiet corner a child tossed a leaf onto the surface and the ripples wrote a kind story about cause and respect. We read it together, smiling, and I felt something inside make room. The mountain likes it when we make room.

On the way down the path offered to carry a little of our worry, and we accepted. That felt like the right kind of trade: attention given, ease received. Back at the road, the valley seemed a bit brighter, but maybe that was just us learning to notice.
