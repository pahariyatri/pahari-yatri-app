We reached the shrine when the afternoon had already folded itself into rain. The bell was sure of its work: draw a circle of attention; let it be enough. Thunder answered from a high court and did not mind being second. Between them, we felt our names become simpler.

A priest waved smoke over our damp shoulders, and for a brief minute the day smelled like cedar and courage. We placed nothing on the altar but our intention to keep walking kindly. The rain understood. The path down was steadier than the one we came up.
