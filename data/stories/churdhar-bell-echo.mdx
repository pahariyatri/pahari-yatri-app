excerpt: >-
  The ridge carried our small vows gently. A bell answered with patience, and
  the day revised our hurry into devotion that felt simple and true.

The ascent began like a long conversation with cedar. We spoke less and heard more. When the temple appeared, it did not perform; it continued. A bell made a careful argument for attention and we accepted.

On the summit the horizon held itself together like a promise kept. We didn’t take many pictures; the day asked us to be present, and we were. On the way down someone confessed they felt simpler. I think that’s what the mountain was after.
