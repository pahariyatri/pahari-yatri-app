  In a valley of mist we walked by attention alone. The map appeared when we
  listened.

The morning refused edges. We did not argue. At each bend the mist invented a new room and we learned to enter with a smaller voice. It was not difficult. It was necessary. If you make yourself light enough, the valley carries you.

We stopped at a stone that looked like a sleeping thought and shared fruit. No one said much. A bird drew a thin line and we followed as if reading a quiet instruction. When the sun considered us and gave back a piece of distance, we were grateful but not urgent. The day would reveal enough.

By evening we had walked a generous mile without proof. The only evidence was a loosened jaw and a conversation that found more listening than speech. That seemed like a good compass to keep.
