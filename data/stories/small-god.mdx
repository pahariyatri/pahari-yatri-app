The path to the shrine knew old songs. We did not sing them; we let the stones do that work. An orange flag wrote a small sentence in the wind and we understood enough to bow. Inside, the bell asked for attention and offered it back.

We did not ask for anything that day. The cedar kept us and the hill agreed. We left with lighter pockets and heavier gratitude.
