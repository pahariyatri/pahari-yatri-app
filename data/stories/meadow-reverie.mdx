  The meadow keeps a gentle ledger: how long you sat, how the thoughts thinned,
  how the small grasses spoke.

We took the longer way so that the afternoon would have time to lift its sleeves. In the low green country, a walking silence drafted us into its small republic. Butterflies stitched our path with a bright, useless thread; we let them. A stream wrote a mild sentence, the kind that forgives you for reading too quickly.

I remember how the mind learned a slower alphabet. The tall grasses leaned in and made some unassuming argument for patience. We tried it, as one tries a warm coat or a new kindness. It fit. We stayed. Someone laughed at nothing. Someone didn’t need to.

Evening set a quiet table. The breeze brought a cup. We drank what was offered—some green flavor of relief. And when we left, the meadow didn’t keep us. It simply pressed a small blessing into our attention: look again, breathe twice, choose the gentler path if you can.
