  Leaves tuned to rain; we walked inside a music that asked nothing and gave
  rest.

The monsoon made a round room of the forest. Ferns held their little green councils and we passed as quiet guests. Every drop was a bell struck clean by gravity. After a while our steps learned the interval; we moved with the weather, not against it.

At a cedar threshold we stood long enough for a story to find us. No words, just the soft ache of things being renewed without ceremony. Moss invented new borders. Streams revised small maps. The heart took notes without ink.

We returned soaked and untroubled, carrying a chant the forest did not mind us borrowing: slow, clear, together. That was enough.
