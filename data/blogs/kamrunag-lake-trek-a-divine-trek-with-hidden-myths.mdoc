Kamrunag Lake is a sacred site dedicated to **Lord Kamrunag**, believed to be the ‘Rain God’ of the region. Devotees offer valuables to the lake, making it a mysterious treasure trove. The trek is open throughout the year but requires local support due to varying weather conditions.

Kamrunag Lake can be reached via multiple routes. The **Rohanda route** involves an **8 km trek**, while the **Devidarh route** offers the shortest trek of **3-4 km**. The most convenient and scenic way is through **Chail-chowk(Saroa)**, where you can either trek or drive closer to the lake.

For travelers looking for a comfortable stay before or after the trek, **Cedar Valley Homestay in Saroa**, located on the Saroa road, is an excellent option. It provides warm hospitality, beautiful mountain views, and easy access to the trek route.

The trek passes through **lush deodar forests, meadows, and scenic valleys**, offering mesmerizing views of the **Dhauladhar and Pir Panjal ranges**. While the trek is accessible year-round, it is advisable to visit with local guides for a safe and enriching experience.
